Version with complete coastline has been used (in previous versions NoCoast was used), because of the better coastline of MEOW/PPOW (eg: a stripe of about 1000x1 Km was missing from land on Adriatic sea), and to the fact that "Saint Pierre et Michelon" and "Tokealu" islands were obliterated by the NoCoast version.
