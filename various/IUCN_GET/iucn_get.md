Several downloads (20231005, 20231021, 20231023, 20240415, 20240412) and contacts with the author (David Keith <david.keith@unsw.edu.au>) were required. Within the various releases:
+  All the objects have been renamed
+  M1.10.WM.nwx_v1.0.json has been added
+  MT2.2.IM.orig_v1.0.json has been added
+  T1.3.WM.nwx_v1.0.json has been updated (old name was: T1_3_Trop_montane_rainforests.json)
+  T7.1.web.alt_v2.0.json has been updated (old name was: T7_1_Croplands.json), but the new version was truncated; consequently:
+  T7.1.web.alt_v2.0.json.bz2 has been obtained by the author
+  S1_2_Endolithic_systems.json exists only in one of the old release.

Vectors (geojson format...) have been imported in PostGIS with the script [import.sh](./import.sh).

PostGIS geometries have been pre-processed with the script [iucn_get.sql](./iucn_get.sql).

The original categories have been reorganized as by [class_code_objects.csv](./class_code_objects.csv).

Flat version has been obtained with the dopa flattening sequence, with configuration as by [workflow_parameters.conf](./workflow_parameters.conf).
